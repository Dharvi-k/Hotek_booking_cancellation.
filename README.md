🎯 Objectives
Identify key features contributing to hotel booking cancellations

Explore booking patterns based on categorical and numerical variables

Perform statistical analysis (e.g., Chi-Square tests) to evaluate associations

Provide data-driven recommendations for reducing cancellations

---
📌 Key Insights
Guests with previous cancellations are significantly more likely to cancel again

Non-refundable deposits are strongly associated with cancellations

Longer lead time (number of days between booking and arrival) increases the chances of cancellation

Customer type influences cancellation: Transient guests tend to cancel more often

Features such as special requests, assigned room vs. reserved room, and booking changes show significant relationships with cancellations

---
Conclusion
This analysis helps hotel managers understand how different customer behaviors and booking characteristics influence cancellations. With better knowledge of these factors, hotels can update policies or offer flexible options to minimize revenue loss from cancellations.
